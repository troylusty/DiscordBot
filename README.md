# Overview

This repository contains all of the code used in my AQA Computer Science NEA Project. The project's objective is to create a Discord bot in [Python](https://www.python.org) using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API wrapper.

**Features include:**

- [x] Moderation (kick/ban/unban, chat cleaner, warnings, announcements)
- [x] Integrations (Steam data integration, Riot Games data integration)
- [x] Full database storage (messages, guild info e.g. prefix, bad manners)
- [x] Member join and leave notifications
- [x] Simple commands (coinflip, dice roll, latency)
- [x] All commands stored using Cogs
- [x] Music playback from YouTube
- [ ] Simple GUI to interact with stored data
- [ ] Alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Mixer)
- [ ] Custom commands (using data from database)
- [ ] Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)
